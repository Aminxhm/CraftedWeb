	<h2>Congratulations!</h2><br /> You've now installed the CraftedWeb CMS on your web host. We sincerely hope that you<br />
        will enjoy all of our hard work on this CMS. Report bugs or any errors to <a href="http://emudevs.com">EmuDevs.com,</a> Thanks!
    <br /><br />
    <b>* TIP!</b> Make a backup of your configuration file. If you accidently remove or<br />
    wipe the data from it, your entire site will stop working.<br />
</p>
<p>
<code>Now, remove the /install folder completely. Otherwise the website will redirect the<br />
    user to the installation page. (You can also just rename the folder, but due to security<br />
    reasons, we suggest that you remove it completely.</code>

<code><b>How do I customize my website even further?</b> There's alot more options to explore<br />
    in the configuration file, and on the Admin panel. Open the <i>includes/configuration.php</i><br />
    file to customize Alot more. Everything should be explained there, so don't worry, you will<br />
    understand what all settings are for. (* Tip: Do not use regular Windows notepad, since<br />
    the file will look very wierd with notepad. ).</code>
