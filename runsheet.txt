    Sandbox fork created (sqladminfork) to test the feasibility of adding further functionality to the CraftedWeb CMS - specifically to include the following;

-+ Specific Features +-

* Generators for in-game objects such as items, quests and events
* Library of sample scripts (C++, lua/eluna etc)
* Parse directly from the CMS to the private server
* PHPMyAdmin (optional DB management tool) inclusion


-+ Other CMS features +-

* Categorised and confirmed resolved "Common Issues" knowledgebase incorporated into the CMS gleaned from the EmuDevs forum
